                <h2>Looking for Alaska</h2>
                <p>
                    Miles Halter is a teenager obsessed with famous last words and is tired of his safe and boring 
                    life at home. He enrolls in a new school in search of what the poet François Rabelais, on his 
                    deathbed, called the "Great Perhaps." Many things await him at Culver Creek, including Alaska Young. 
                    Intelligent, funny, troubled, and extremely alluring, Alaska will lead Miles into her labyrinth and 
                    catapult him toward the Great Perhaps.
